# Deck of Cards

## Description: 

This project is about building a deck of cards in Ruby. This is accomplished by creating two objects: a Card and a Deck of 52 cards.

This project was built using the Ruby programming language along with the test library rspec.

The goal was to make as many of the specs pass as possible. You can run all of the specs by following the instructions below.  

## Installation:

To clone this project locally and run the rspec tests, do the following:

- ensure you have ruby installed on your machine
```bash
git clone < https://github.com/bchecchia/Deck_of_Cards.git>
cd < cards_and_decks>
run the "Deck Specks" by running rspec ./spec/deck_spec.rb , or the "Card Specs" by running rspec ./spec/card_spec.rb
```

## Usage: 

The first piece of functionality built was an individual Card object consisting of a face value and a suit.

This Card was then tested against 13 examples in the rspec library.

The second piece of funtionality built was a set of 52 cards with the shuffle and draw feature. 

This Deck was then tested againt 7 examples in the rspec library.

## Project status:

This project is still being develped and has the potential for more features and functionality.
